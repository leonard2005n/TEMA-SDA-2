The implementetion is based on two data structures a min_heap to generete  
the binarry tree like is written in the homework. The tree is consturcted  
at the same as the new satelites are created.  
This is done by the function `create_sateleite_tree` that returns the binary  
tree that is need for the tasks.

---

## TASK 1

This is done by the function `print_levels`. That is self explanatory it will  
print the levels of the binary tree using the **BFS algorithm** behind.

---

## TASK 2

In this task you need to decode the message that is given in the file. At  
first it will read the firs line of the message and then it will travers  
the line charcater by character. Then it will check if the charcter is  
`'0'` and if it is it will go to the left or if the character is `'1'` it will  
go to the right. It will do this until the node is a leaf in the tree and it will  
print the name of the satelite. Then it will go to the next line and so on.

---

## TASK 3

This is taks is about us encoding the message like the one in the task before.  
To do so we will go to a recursive function that it will stop at the node  
that we need to codify. It will check if the node we need to find is in the name  
of the left child or the right child and if it is it will go that way in a recursive  
way and it will print the coreesponded message as it goes.

---

## TASK 4

In this task we need to find the common parent of a bunch of satelites. At first  
we will find the first satelit to have a refrence of where we should go. Then we will  
read the next name of the next satelite and if it isn't in the name it will go to his  
parent. And it will do this until the name is in the satlite name. And it will do this  
for the next satelites. In the finl we will have the parent of the nodes.
